<h1>&gt; slack-rtm</h1>
<p>
After learning slack had <a href="https://it.slashdot.org/story/18/03/08/2049255/slack-is-shutting-down-its-irc-gateway">removed support</a> for <a href="https://slack.com/account/gateways">irc gateways</a>, I wanted to see what their alternative was for an api.
I knew about some of the web API because I've messed around with <a href="https://hubot.github.com/">hubots</a> for various slack orgs I've been in, but I took an nice dive into the docs with the idea that I wanted to send myself a message via curl.
I ended up using just a little more (needed something that spoke "websocket"), but I'll do a little writeup for what was required to do this.
</p>

<h2>APIs</h2>
<p>
First thing was figuring out the high-level route, and after some reading of slacks api docs pages, I determined that I'd need
<ol>
	<li>a slack app, with an auth key that has the proper permissions or oauth scopes (in this case "client")</li>
	<li>curl the <a href="https://api.slack.com/methods/rtm.connect"><code>rtm.connect</code></a> REST endpoint to get a websocket connection</li>
	<li>use a websocket client to send a json formatted message event via the <a href="https://api.slack.com/rtm">rtm api</a></li>
</ol>
With websockets, REST, and oauth roles it's very 5-years-ago's next-gen web&tm; (and I'm really not sure what today's next-gen web is, but I imagine it's  http 2.0 functional monito blockchains).
</p>

<h2>Auth</h2>
<p>
Here's what I did to get a token with the correct permissions (it was not obvious, and I wonder if slack will disallow this at some point):
<ol>
	<li>create a new app if you haven't already <a href="https://api.slack.com/apps">here</a>
	<li>go to app control panel and open the "Add features and functionality" dropdown and select "Permissions"</li>
	<li>right-click on <code>Reinstall App</code> button underneath the access token and copy the link location. It should look something like
	<pre><code>https://slack.com/oauth/authorize?client_id=123456789.9876543&team=TXXXXXXXX&install_redirect=oauth&scope=chat:write:user</code></pre></li>
	<li>modify the <code>scope</code> url parameter to read <code>scope=client</code>
	<pre><code>https://slack.com/oauth/authorize?client_id=123456789.9876543&team=TXXXXXXXX&install_redirect=oauth&scope=client</code></pre></li>
	<li>go to that url in a browser, and accept the change in permissions; now the access token will have <a href="https://api.slack.com/scopes/client">client scope</a></li>
</ol>
Now you can use the app's token to access a bunch of REST endpoints.
</p>

<h2>socket up</h2>
<p>
I made a little shell function while I was poking around the REST endpoints, you may find it useful too:
</p>
<pre><code
>$ slackc() {
	method=$1
	api=$2
	shift 2
	curl -X $method -d "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" $@ "https://slack.com/api/$api"
}
</code></pre>
<p>
I chose <a href="https://github.com/danielstjules/wsc"><code>wsc</code></a> as a websocket client because it was easy to install via <code>npm</code> and small.
</p>
<pre><code
>$ npm install wsc
$ alias wsc=<path to node_modules>/wsc/wsc
</code></pre>
<p>
Now, you can call
</p>
<pre><code
>$ TOKEN=&lt;app token, starts with "xoxp-"&gt;
$ slackc GET rtm.connect |jq . >rtm.connect.txt
$ wsc $(&lt;rtm.connect.txt jq .url |sed 's/^"//' |sed 's/"$//')
</code></pre>
<p>
You need to replace <code>&lt;app token...&gt;</code> with your slack app's app token from earlier.
Here, we call the <code>rtm.connect</code> REST endpoint, which returns some json that has a websocket url among other things.
The little shell stuff is just extracting the url via <code>jq</code>, and stripping the beginning and ending quotes with <code>sed</code>.
</p>
<p>
Now you've got a slack rtm connection.
</p>

<h2>Talk to yourself <sub>because no one else will</sub></h2>
<p>
I joined an im with myself using the slack webclient, and got an event in <code>wsc</code>
</p>
<pre><code
>&lt; {"type":"im_open","user":"UXXXXXXXX","channel":"DXXXXXXXX","event_ts":"1527543437.000020"}
</code></pre>
<p>
That showed me the channel id I needed <code>DXXXXXXXX</code>, and I sent a message to myself:
</p>
<pre><code
>&gt; { "id": 1, "type": "message", "channel": "DXXXXXXXX", "text": "testing this websocket" }
</code></pre>
<p>
and it showed up in the webclient!
</p>
