<h1>&gt; slack-rtm</h1>
<p>After learning slack had <a href="https://it.slashdot.org/story/18/03/08/2049255/slack-is-shutting-down-its-irc-gateway">removed support</a> for <a href="https://slack.com/account/gateways">irc gateways</a>,
I wanted to see what their alternative was for an api.
I knew about some of the web API because I've messed around with <a href="https://hubot.github.com/">hubots</a> for various slack orgs I've been in, but I took a nice dive into the docs with the idea that I wanted to send myself a message via curl.
I ended up using just a little more (needed something that spoke &quot;websocket&quot;), and here's my little writeup for what was required.</p>
<h2>APIs</h2>
<p>First thing was figuring out the high-level route, and after some reading of slack api doc pages, I determined that I'd need</p>
<ol>
<li>a slack app, with an auth key that has the proper permissions or oauth scopes (in this case &quot;client&quot;)</li>
<li>curl the <a href="https://api.slack.com/methods/rtm.connect"><code>rtm.connect</code></a> REST endpoint to get a websocket connection</li>
<li>use  awebsocket client to send a json formatted message event via the <a href="https://api.slack.com/rtm">rtm api</a></li>
</ol>
<p>With websockets, REST, and oauth roles, it's very 5-years-ago's next-gen webâ„¢ (and I'm really not sure what today's next-gen web is, but I imagine it's http 2.0 functional monito blockchains).</p>
<h2>Auth</h2>
<p>Here's what I did to get a token with the correct permissions (it was not obvious, and I wonder if slack will disallow this at some point):</p>
<ol>
<li>create a [new app] if you haven't already</li>
<li>go to app control panel and open the &quot;Add features and functionality&quot; dropdown and select &quot;Permissions&quot;</li>
<li>right-click on <code>Reinstall App</code> button underneath the access token and copy the link location. It should look something like</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>https://slack.com/oauth/authorize?client_id=123456789.9876543&amp;team=TXXXXXXXX&amp;install_redirect=oauth&amp;scope=chat:write:user
</code></pre>
<ol start="4">
<li>modify the <code>scope</code> url parameter to read <code>scope=client</code></li>
</ol>
<pre><code>https://slack.com/oauth/authorize?client_id=123456789.9876543&amp;team=TXXXXXXXX&amp;install_redirect=oauth&amp;scope=client
</code></pre>
<ol start="5">
<li>visit that url in a browser, and accept the change in permissions; now the access token will have <a href="https://api.slack.com/scopes/client">client scope</a></li>
</ol>
<p>Now you can use the app's token to access a bunch of REST endpoints.</p>
<h2>socket up</h2>
<p>I made a little shell function while I was poking around the REST endpoints, you may find it useful too:</p>
<pre><code>$ slackc() {
	method=$1
	api=$2
	shift 2
	curl -X $method -d &quot;Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN&quot; $@ &quot;https://slack.com/api/$api&quot;
}
</code></pre>
<p>I chose <a href="https://github.com/danielstjules/wsc">wsc</a> as a websocket client because it was small and easy to install via <code>npm</code>.</p>
<pre><code>$ npm install wsc
$ alias wsc=&lt;path to node_modules&gt;/wsc/wsc
</code></pre>
<p>Now, you can call</p>
<pre><code>$ TOKEN=&lt;app token, starts with &quot;xoxp-&quot;&gt;
$ slackc GET rtm.connect |jq . &gt;rtm.connect.txt
$ wsc $(&lt;rtm.connect.txt jq .url |sed 's/^&quot;//' |sed 's/&quot;$//')
</code></pre>
<p>You need to replace <code>&lt;app token...&gt;</code> with your slack app token which can be found on the app settings page in slack.
Here we call the <code>rtm.connect</code> REST endpoint, which returns some json that has a websocket url among other things.
The little shell stuff is there to extract the url via <code>jq</code>, and strip the quote characters with <code>sed</code></p>
<p>Now you've got a slack rtm connection.</p>
<h2>Talk to yourself</h2>
<p>I joined an im with myself using the slack webclient, and got an event in <code>wsc</code></p>
<pre><code>&lt; {&quot;type&quot;:&quot;im_open&quot;,&quot;user&quot;:&quot;UXXXXXXXX&quot;,&quot;channel&quot;:&quot;DXXXXXXXX&quot;,&quot;event_ts&quot;:&quot;1527543437.000020&quot;}
</code></pre>
<p>That showed me the channel id I needed <code>DXXXXXXXX</code>, and I sent a message to myself:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>{ &quot;id&quot;: 1, &quot;type&quot;: &quot;message&quot;, &quot;channel&quot;: &quot;DXXXXXXXX&quot;, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;testing this websocket&quot; }</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and it showed up in the webclient!</p>
